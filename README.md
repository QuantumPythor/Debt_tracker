# Debt_tracker
The primary function of the application is to consolidate and net all outstanding transactions between any two people (e.g., A and M). Instead of tracking multiple small transactions in both directions, the system calculates the single, net balance owed between the pair, providing a clear and minimal record of who owes whom. Example among 3 people.
