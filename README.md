​💰 Debt Tracker
​A simple command-line Python utility for managing and consolidating bilateral debts within a fixed group (A, M, and S). It automatically nets transactions between pairs, providing a clear, simplified view of the current financial status.
​⚠️ Important Note
​This script is dedicated only to debt consolidation and tracking. The initial debts generated from shared expenses (e.g., grocery calculations) are handled by a separate script, ensuring a clear separation of concerns (Expense Calculation vs. Debt Management).
​✨ Features
​Bilateral Netting: All transactions between two people (e.g., A ↔ M) are consolidated into a single, net debt amount.
​Persistent Storage: Debt records are automatically stored and retrieved from a local CSV file (CSVs/debt_data.csv).
​Interactive CLI: Easy-to-use command-line interface for adding debts and viewing the current status.
​Debt Aging: Displays the age of current debts for quick follow-up on outstanding payments.
